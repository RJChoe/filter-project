# Skincare Allergy Filter

## Project Overview
The **Skincare Allergy Filter** is a web application that helps users determine if skincare products are safe based on their personal allergies. Users can enter their allergies along with a product's ingredient list, and the app will check for potential allergens and return a safety recommendation.

---

## Features
- **Personal Allergy Input:** Users can list their known allergens.
- **Ingredient Check:** Users can input a skincare product’s ingredient list.
- **Safety Alert:** The app notifies whether the product is safe or contains allergens.

---

## How It Works
1. Users enter their personal allergies (e.g., nuts, parabens, fragrance).  
2. Users input the skincare product's ingredient list.  
3. The application compares the ingredient list against the user's allergies.  
4. The app returns a result:
   - **Safe:** No allergens detected.
   - **Unsafe:** Product contains one or more allergens.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Python Django (handles both frontend and backend)  
- **Database:** SQLite (default) or any Django-supported database
